# AnisotropicInk_HonorsProject_FA2023
This repository will hold all scripts used to perform data analysis and lab work for the Honors research project seeking to characterize anisotropic ink for printed electronic circuits. The goal of the code included in this repository is to streamline the analysis of Excel data obtained from using the Keysight Precision Network Analyzer for waveguide measurements. A rudimentary FFT routine was written, but this needs refinement if it is to be used for analyzing data used for a critical project. The code herein is a first revision as of December 19, 2023, but can be modified for any purpose required in the lab.
